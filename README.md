<h1>Predicting Nephritis with Machine Learning</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

This project focuses on predicting two medical conditions—inflammation and nephritis—using a machine learning approach on patient symptom data. The dataset consists of features such as body temperature, nausea, lumbar pain, burning sensation, and micturition (urinary symptoms). The preprocessing steps included converting yes/no categorical responses into binary values and splitting the data into training and validation sets. Support Vector Classifiers (SVC) were trained to predict the presence of inflammation and nephritis, with hyperparameter tuning performed using GridSearchCV to improve model accuracy. Visualizations such as correlation heatmaps provided insights into feature relationships, while pie charts revealed the distribution of symptoms across positive and negative cases of inflammation and nephritis. Confusion matrices helped assess the performance of the models, showing the number of correct and incorrect predictions. This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning models to assist in diagnosing inflammatory diseases efficiently.
